# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris Dataset
 
**Project Overview:**

_This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset, a classic dataset commonly used in data science. The dataset contains measurements of four features for 150 samples of iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species._

**Objectives:**

_Data Loading and Exploration:_

_Import necessary Python libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
Load the Iris dataset and explore its structure._

**Basic Statistical Analysis:**

_Perform basic statistical analysis on the dataset._

**Data Visualization:**

_Create visualizations to understand relationships between features and the distribution of each feature for each iris species._

**Implementation:**

_•	Code File: data analysis EDa ON Iris Dataset.py_

_•	Python script containing the code for the EDA on the Iris dataset._

**Instructions for Running the Code:**

_•	Install required libraries: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn._

_•	Run the code in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE) step by step._


**Additional Notes:**

_The project is designed for beginners to gain hands-on experience with data manipulation and visualization using Python.
Feel free to modify the code, experiment, and explore further._

**Results:**

_The project generates visualizations and basic statistics to provide insights into the Iris dataset._

**Future Improvements:
**
_Consider extending the analysis by implementing machine learning models for classification.

Explore additional datasets and adapt the code for different datasets._
